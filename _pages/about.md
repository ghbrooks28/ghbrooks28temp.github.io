I am a PhD candidate in my fifth year at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/index.php) under the advisement of [Dr. Linyuan Lu](https://people.math.sc.edu/lu/).

My research broadly falls under the area of *extremal combinatorics*, specifically in the setting of (hyper)graphs. The properties I have studied include linear combinations of eigenvalues over families of graphs, the <span>&#8467;<sub>2 </sub>-norm of (hyper)graphs, and the order of graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature with applications to data science.
